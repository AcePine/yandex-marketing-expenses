# yandex-marketing-expenses
This notebook is the result of helping Yandex.Afisha's marketing department optimizes expenses.

We go into our Exploratory Data Analysis process to clean the data and prepare to produce insights.

From there, we begin to dive into the cleaned data - finding multiple ways to help Yandex optimize expenses by finding retention rates, average purchase sizes and more.

# Conclusion

After extensive analysis of the data, we have some obvious conclusions about where the marketing team should focus their resources.

We found the DAU, WAU, and MAU and plotted each of them. It's clear that our highest usage occurs in the winter months - November is the month with the highest usage. Summer months see about half the active users compared to winter months. Should we lean into campaigning in the winter months, or is there a promotion we can run to increase usage in the summer months?

To get more granular, we learned in our analysis that we typically see the most user activity on Mondays and specifically Thursdays. We can lean into this by increasing our marketing outreach on these days. We can also work to improve our LTV and retention rate by running promotions for existing users on the days where the most users are active (Mondays & Thursdays), or when users spend the most time with us (Fridays)

Looking at our average purchase size over time, we can see that users have the highest average spend during the Holiday months. We can ramp up our marketing resources through the channels mentioned above in the months coming up to the Holiday months, to maximize the retained users for their highest average spends. We see that our highest retention rates are between 1-5 months, so we'd want to begin to ramp up marketing late in the 3rd Quarter, before the 4th Quarter begins.
The mean revenue is 5.00

Sessions per user float between 1.2 - 1.4, so typically our users use our product about once per month. What can we do to convince users to come back more than once a month? Attacking the summer months seems like low-hanging fruit for a promotion of some sort.

Revenue and visits both fall drastically after the first month.

Overall CAC is consistant throughout the year.

ROI generally increases to 1 over time, which is essential for a profitable business.

The spring months are where we begin to see a drop in nearly all metrics.

The fall months are where we begin to see most of our metrics rise.

December provides us with a small bump in revenue.

Nearly all users who convert will do so within the first day.

This means the best time to convert users is the first day!

Website visits and revenue seem to move together.

More time is spent by users during the week, than the weekend. Friday has the longest session on average, and Sunday has the shortest!

Orders per buyer seems to be trending up throughout the lifetime of the average user. That's great!

LTV tends to go up overtime. That's really good! However, our initial LTV is trending downward with each new cohort. We need to figure out a way to get them to spend more money, sooner.

Costs were low in the summer, but that's followed by low usage by our users, and not a lot of revenue.

We should make it cheaper in the summer for users to use the product, we may incentivize more user activity and revenue.
