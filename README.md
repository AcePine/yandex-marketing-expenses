# Project Name

## Project Description

This project involves analyzing and visualizing user data to gain insights into user retention, purchasing behavior, and revenue generation. It focuses on cohort analysis, retention rates, conversion times, orders per buyer, average purchase size, and customer lifetime value (LTV). The project is divided into several sections, each providing valuable insights into user behavior.

## Cohort Analysis

### User Retention

The first section of the project involves calculating user retention rates. We use a cohort analysis to understand how different cohorts of users behave over time. The data is organized into cohorts based on the month in which users first engaged with the platform. We calculate the percentage of users who continue to use the platform in subsequent months.

### Visualization of Retention Rates

To visualize the retention rates, we use a heatmap. Each cell in the heatmap represents the retention rate for a specific cohort and age (time since the cohort's first interaction). The heatmap provides a clear overview of how retention rates change over time.

## Conversion Time Analysis

### Average Conversion Time

The next section focuses on understanding the average time it takes for a user to convert from a visitor to a buyer. We calculate the conversion time by subtracting the first session date from the first purchase date and display the results in a histogram. The median conversion time is also calculated.

## Orders and Revenue Analysis

### Orders per Buyer

We analyze the number of orders made by users during different months after their initial interaction with the platform. A pivot table is created to show the number of orders per buyer for different cohorts and their corresponding ages.

### Average Purchase Size

The average purchase size is calculated by finding the mean of the revenue generated by orders. A histogram is created to visualize the distribution of average purchase sizes.

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

LTV is calculated to understand how much money is generated by different cohorts of users over time. A pivot table is created to display the LTV for each cohort over various ages.

## Cost Analysis

### Marketing Costs

The project also includes an analysis of marketing costs. It involves understanding the amount of money spent on marketing from different sources over time. The marketing cost data is used to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

## Conclusion

In the conclusion section, the key findings and insights from each analysis are summarized. Recommendations and potential areas for improvement are provided based on the observed trends and patterns.

This project is a comprehensive analysis of user behavior, retention, and revenue generation, aiming to help make informed decisions to improve the platform's performance and profitability.
